## Introduction

The Army Battle Simulator is a project that demonstrates the use of data structures and algorithms by simulating a combat scenario between two armies. Each army consists of three different unit types, and they battle each other until one side is defeated. 

## Features

- Generate two armies with different unit types
- Simulate a battle until one army wins
- Configurable unit strengths and weaknesses
- Randomized but strategic attacks

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
